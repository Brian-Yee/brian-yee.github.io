Advanced Calc II
================

On March 26th, 2012, I milled into my Advanced Calculus II class that occurred
shortly before lunch. It was the final course of calculus required for my
curriculum before breaking us off to specialize in courses dedicate to the field
of differential equations. It was useful in formalizing many multidimenisonal
abstractions such as
[Jacobians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) and
emphasizing the use of a change of mathematical basis: the ways one can measure
and quantify space. The apex of this course culminated in learning was being
able to calculate the so-called "TBN-vectors" which are more formally referred
to as the [Frenet‚ÄìSerret
formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenet%E2%80%93Serret_formulas) in the
study of [Differential
Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry). TBN-Vectors
allow one to calculate an orthogonal reference frame along a continuous curve in
3D-space. The initialism TBN refers to the three types of vectors that occur for
every point in space referred to as tangential, binormal and normal. Each vector
exists orthogonally (at 90 degree angles) to another as if they were the edges
that connect a corner of a cube. For whatever reason these were the hardest
things for me to grapple with mathematically at the time. I'm gonna skip the
math and just post a gif of what this looks like.

There's clearly a lot going on in the gif, which hopefully gives credence to my
previous mathematical difficulties encountered with TBN vectors. Of course there
is something to be said about the trajectories upon which TBN vectors need be
calculated. The more complicated the trajectory the more complicated the TBN
vectors. Unbeknownst to me on that same day a trajectory would be entered into
meme culture...

Mr. Bones' Wild Ride
====================

Mr. Bones' Wild Ride is a roller coaster ride created in Roller Coaster
Tycoon 2. It was originally posted on March 26th, 2012 with details about the
ride including an apparent 4 years of game time required for each passenger to
finish with them constantly yelling "I want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride!" in
between. Unfortunately, for the passengers at the conclusion of the ride, upon
exiting, they are met with a short path that leads only to the entrance of the
ride. If that wasn't cruel enough they are met with a giant skeleton (assumedly
Mr. Bones) and a sign saying ‚ÄúThe ride never ends.‚Äù

The meme has since spread far and wide, morphing into various homages as well as
a [creepypasta](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepypasta) and association with
["2Spooky"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/2spooky) and the ["Spooky, Scary
Skeleton's"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spooky-scary-skeletons) song. The
reasons for this are, of course, a matter of debate but I think like the food
industry's [bliss point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_point_(food)) "Mr.
Bones' Wild Ride" strikes a meticulously balanced composition of: a unique
pretense, good clean fun, and soul crushing existential dread. We laugh because
our only other option is to cry. That fate is a cruel cycle, doomed to repeat
itself indefinetely has been touted throughout history. From the
ancient cities of Greece to the highest regions of Nepal this idea has persisted
throughout religion and in the modern landscape devoid of religion Mr. Bones'
stands in place as either a [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God), [Grim
Reaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)) or some sort of
[Shinigami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinigami) in between. Ask yourself:
would the joke be nearly as funny if the skeleton was the same size as the
virtual people and simply held the sign with two bony hands? Of course not,
because at the core of this meme is the idea that we are behooven to a higher
power. The fact that here we are mercy to a maniacal, gargantuan, top-hat
tipping, skeleton named "Mr. Bones" only underscores the absurdity of the lives
of these pixelated individuals. To laugh at this picture is not to laugh at Mr.
Bones nor to laugh with him, it is to laugh at The Absurd: capital "T" capital
"A".

The Myth of Sisyphus
====================

The Absurd has it's routes in primarily two philosophers, each with badass
names: S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Albert Camus. Kierkegaard was the first to tackle
The Absurd and as a byproduct introducing the concept now known today as "[a
leap of faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_of_faith)". The escapement of
The Absurd is so inscrutably difficult that one must take an illogical but
perhaps neccessary religious jump into the unknown. Camus 50 years later would
call Kierkegaard's solution one of "philosophical suicide" claiming the ideal
answer was not one of escape but to revolt against The Absurd. Freed from the
shackles of religious and moral convictions one is free to experience life to
their fullest. One must seek meaning out of meaninglessness while not succumbing
to the tempting possibilities of nihilism or religious servitude

> There is so much stubborn hope in the human heart. The most destitute men
> often end up by accepting illusion. That approval prompted by the need for
> peace inwardly parallels the existential consent. There are thus gods of
> light and idols of mud. But it is essential to find the middle path leading
> to the faces of man.
>
> Albert Camus. The Myth of Sisyphus

The Myth of Sisyphus in which Camus discussed his philosophy of The Absurd to
greatest detail ends on the note that Sisyphus -- banished to eternal damnation
via the hard labour of rolling a rock up a hill -- must accept his fate and
smile as he walks back down to roll the rock back up.

</p>

The equivalent for Mr. Bones' Spooky Ride would be for the virtual people to
smile in the brief moments they have walking between the exit and re-entrance.
In this less romantic metaphor one becomes sympathetic to Kierkegaard's
forethought of this line of reasoning as "demoniac madness" that must be
abandoned by placing faith in god. Still considering that the virtual people
place their faith in a higher power than Mr. Bones -- a benevolent creator who
created their whole roller coaster park universe also seems equally absurd...

Bonne F√™te! Compagnon de Mis√®res.
=================================

Now I cannot, nor will not, for a second claim I can resolve the dispute between
these two heavyweight hitters of existentialism. All I can do is point out to
others the themes I observe in Mr. Bones' Spooky Ride and my Advanced Calculus
II class. When I look at Mr. Bones' Spooky Ride existentialist absurd philosophy
is not the only thing to come to mind -- I wonder what the TBN vectors and
g-force the riders experience. For however abysmal or appalling their existence
may be, they are not immune to the laws Roller Coasters as trajectories in space
must abide by.

Each individual on a roller coaster is free to take the action to infer their
own TBN vectors. Such complex calculus on such a wild ride seems impossibly
difficult if not for the fact that the centripetal force experienced is that of
the normal vector defined as an [osculating
circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osculating_circle). We need not know of
some advanced system for understand local reference frames on the ride we need
only pay attention to the forces that are applied to us. Of course, in the the
real world there exists no such global trajectory, no one path that we all
follow through life. Every person will be succumbed to different forces pulling
and pushing us this way and that. In the condition of human existence it is less
the ride that creates the physical TBN-vector forces but the vector forces that
are linked together temporarily to construct some trajectory. In some manner the
conditions of our lives is more akin to pixelated individuals in "Mr. Bones'
Wild Roller Coaster Park" and us the pixelated individuals, free to choose any
wild ride but confined until death to stay in the park.

It this interpretation as we walk between rides and occasionally have the fortune
of bumping into each other it is not Camus or Kierkegaard's advice that rings the
most true but Schopenhauer's

> man ought to be, not *monsieur, sir,* but *fellow sufferer, compagnon de

> which each of us needs and which each of us therefore owes.

The Worldly Table
=================

While the opinions of Kierkegaard and Camus certainly provide an excellent
starting point for individualistic concerns -- at the start of 2020 it appears
the Schopenhauerian interpretation will be of the most benefit in the coming
year. The news this week has highlighted unprecedented levels of partisanship in
the USA, concerns of pandemic outbreaks in China and a firmly rejected peace
plan in the Middle East. It is tempting to take refuge and "Want to get off Mr.
Bones' Wild Ride" but the world and The Absurd are here to stay. At this time,
the best one can do is reflect on one's own life trajectory and consider what
they can do and be ready to greet the fellow passengers they will meet along the
way. We are all on Mr. Bones' Wild Ride although our frames of reference may all
appear vastly different.

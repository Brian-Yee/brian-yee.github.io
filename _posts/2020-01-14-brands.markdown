Everything is Branding
======================

> Everything is branding

I hear this a lot, most often at work and I think the way it is usually
conceived is dangerous. It's easy to let ourselves be defined through our work
since after all it's what we do for a third or more of the day but it is
important to realize that it is one _facet_ of our existence. When "Everything
is branding" is taken to heart it is tempting to believe that everything in the
world is in fact branding including ourselves, but how useful is this knowledge?
If I said everything is functional programming and pointed at syntactic sugar
used in an imperative way claiming that it's really functional have I missed the
point? Furthermore isn't it more accurate to say that everything is a
fundamental constituent of matter? What does this knowledge of fermions and
bosons actually give me to better live my life as a human being?

The familiarity we have with our jobs and economical/capilitistic thought makes
it easy to constantly frame things in what appears common and appears easy.
Despite many of our lives constantly being evaluated by an economic view its
application on a day-to-day level can feel inorganic. As the joke goes

perhaps if the reader is apt to be content with the statistical [Value of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life) pegged at less than 10
million per person, this post will be of little interest. For those interested
in the noumenon or less stringently that the juicy details are in the variance
and not the aggregate, read on.

What is Not Branding?
=====================

The concept of "branding" in "everything is branding" no doubt varies from
individual to individual. For now, let us adopt the pedestrian definition of the
modern brand in that truism expressed as "everything is based around a
cultivated perception of an abstract concept usually pertaining to a way of life
that is invoked when a sign is signaled". It is easy to see how the modern view
of branding has originated given we have been putting marks on things for
utility purposes ever since ancient times. A particularly ancient practice of
branding occurs in the marking or livestock dating back to 2700BC in Ancient
Egypt. The Ancient Romans also practice livestock branding and some further
believed that the brand could be part of a magic spell to impart upon their
livestock to increases safety of their asset.

The idea of attaching meaning to a symbol -- one of a mystic or religious
connotation is the first anomaly of the "everything is branding" doctrine. The
notion of branding livestock with, for simplicity and familiarity let us say a:
Cross, Star of David, Pentagram, Taijitu, Pentagram etc differs from the
branding of livestock with McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King, Subway. Furthermore
the inversion of asymmetrical religious signs may carry a connotation more
severe then the inversion of one of the non-religious "brands" or being
[subvertised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvertising). At this point we are
not arguing about _branding_ anymore so much as we are arguing about the field
of _semiotics_, the study of sign processing and the creation of meaning. We are
now less concerned about branding itself so much as a framework to describe
reality of which branding is a part of and with this we are _empowered_ to
attach our line of thought to the opinions of experts who focus on contextualize
nuances.

The Semiotics of Branding
=========================

Let us look at the rather straightforwardly named paper the [The Semiotics of
Brands](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.anthro.012809.104939)
by Paul Mannings. The abstract reads

> Approaches to the semiotics of brand are troubled by the lack of any accepted
> analytic definition of the phenomenon, as well as capacious, almost
> metaphysical, extensions in which brand becomes identified with semiosis as
> such, and thus **everything is a brand**. In addition, studies of brand tend to
> focus on highly visible or successful brands, as often as not as a proxy for a
> real object of analytic interest that lies elsewhere. Brand discourse defines
> brand in opposition to the material properties of the product, leading to a
> dematerialization of brand, which erases the messy materialities,
> contingencies, and hybrids that continually arise in the material semiosis of
> brand. Rather than attempt a definition of brand, the recent literature on
> brand semiotics is explored along several material and semiotic dimensions of
> the variousness of its relationship to its universes of circulation and in
> different professional discourses and historical and cultural contexts.
>
> _[Modified via bolding added for emphasis]_

Which uses extraordinarily complicated language for experts to communicate
exceptionally specific details of what brands mean. Let us break down the
central premises of their work for our use

1. The lack of definition of a brand, allows modern "new-wisdoms" such as
   "Everything is Branding".
2. On average the study of "brands" is really the study of _successful_ brands.
3. Brands are not defined by what they are but namely what they are not: their product.
4. Recent literature on brand semiotics has moved out of modernism into post-modernism.

Of these points, the third is perhaps the most deceptively informative. Mannings
cites other papers in a particularly elucidatory excerpt

> [A]s brand guru David Ogilvy put it in 1955, [the brand is] the “intangible
> sum of a product’s attributes, its name, packaging, and price, its history,
> reputation, and the way it is advertised” (cited in Wang 2007, pp. 23–24), to
> leaving behind the dull, passive, generic, inert utility and materiality of
> the product entirely, taking on an “enchanting, sometimes religious
> character,” adding a “spiritual dimension to what used to be ‘merely a
> product’” (Askegard 2006, p. 96).

Although perhaps it is too modest to call [David
Ogilvy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ogilvy_(businessman)) only a "guru
of branding" given he is credited as The Father of Branding. This priveleged
doublet formed by the pair of brand/product fits within a [folk
psychology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/folkpsych-theory/) arranging the
world in ontologies of opposing doublets such as form/function,
decorative/functional, and immaterial/material. The brand is imbued with a
mystique that is derived from a realm separate from the material of the product
itself, placing emphasis not on the utility of the item but on its ephemeral
and enchanting character.

Brands as Meta-Symbols
======================

The intangible and ambiguous nature separating brand from product makes it
difficult to pin down a definition

> thus everywhere, and yet nowhere, the phenomenon [of branding] comes to be
> represented as an essentially immaterial form of mediation, a kind of
> globalized interdiscursivity, an indexical icon of the virtual nature of the
> global capitalist economy itself

This tying of brands to global capitalism results in

> [M]uch analytic attention [given] to specific highly salient western brands
> (Coca-Cola, Nike) that serve as what Miller (1998) calls “meta-symbols” of
> aspects of this global culture of circulation: “So Coca-Cola is not merely
> material culture, it is a symbol that stands for a debate about material
> culture” (p. 170).

Thus to speak of brands or branding is to pull in the ideologies of the system
that propagates the brands themselves. If you point to a "brand" you can equally
point anywhere within the system and claim that that it is part of the brand as
well. One can be in Peru and point to the coffee fields as part of the "brand"
of McDonalds since it lies in the coffee belt between the tropics of Cancer and
Capricorn and utilizes only the _finest arabica_ beans. Yet it would be hard
when faced with the reality of workers conditions to not consider the
implications of the global economy and how the supposedly _finest arabica beans_
are provided. To point at the "Two Golden Arches" arches and say that _that_ is
the brand of McDonalds is inherently misguided, for you have just read and
understood what I meant by saying "Two Golden Arches" without seeing the logo
itself. The brand of McDonalds exceeds far beyond it's definitive and
understandably priveleged logo that signals it the strongest. It is not a
question of language trickery but the insertion of the word "Golden" here that
has allowed McDonalds to pervade this paragraph.

Thus to say that "Everything is branding." is in the most crude sense to say
something tautological from within one's own framework. One has not been further
equipped to solve a problem but rather unite any other individuals in the room
via rhetorical technique. In the workplace setting, where everyone is exchanging
time for money, it signals a value that nobody can disagree with without
undermining the setting in which it is being said. That is to say it is
particularly clever [speech act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act).
Indeed the [Copenhagen
school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_School_(international_relations))
adopts the view of a speech act as

> whereby the speaker, often politicians or players, act in accordance to the
> truth but in preparation for the audience to take action in the directions of
> the player that are driven or incited by the act. This forms an observable
> framework under a specified subject matter from the player, and the audience
> who are 'under-theorised [would] remain outside of the framework itself, and
> would benefit from being both brought in and drawn out.'[34] It is because the
> audience would not be informed of the intentions of the player, except to
> focus on the display of the speech act itself. Therefore, in the perspective
> of the player, the truth of the subject matter is irrelevant except the result
> produced via the audience.[35]

These speech acts extend to many business mantras used in the work-place. The
truisms they contain so far as in the context of business relations are grasped
within a tautological sense. The action itself is less to inform the individuals
receiving knowledge so much as to entertain the people in the room with tidbits,
quips or factoids, each of which _never_ authentically display the true motive
of the speaker. If during a physics tutoring session the tutor said "Everything
is branding." the student would understandably be confused. However, via
substitution of some truism such as "Everything is a solution." it would
entertain the student to look at what the tutor wants, while in no way actually
preparing the student for an upcoming exam. Still, if the tutor uses the speech
act correctly it may aid the student along the process of studying and be a part
of increasing their performance. It is a tool to appeal to the _[pathos]()_ of
the audience.

Summary & Conclusion
====================

We have discussed the semiotics of branding and how discussion of it can occur
in Western business settings. Business mantras were shown to be a useful form of
a speech act to employ rhetoric in uniting a room of individuals to follow an
undisclosed agenda of the speaker. It was emphasized that the speech act is not
nefarious but rather a tool to appeal the pathos of the audience. Arguably the
usefulness of the statement ends there and further pontification of the point
outside of that setting can lead to the invokation of global capitilism as the
most forefront of mind brands eventually morph into meta-symbols. Thus, let us
appreciate and be aware of the use of such speech acts and how they affect the
audience particularly when we are within them. Hopefully from them, we too can
learn how to unite others to drive business forward lest we eventually adopt the
mantras spoken as a way to unite our fractured selves.

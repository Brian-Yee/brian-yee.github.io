The Season of Dichomoties
=========================

Every year for about two weeks after New Years it comes into vogue to be elitist. At the stroke of
midnight, an invisible line falls from the sky segregating humanity at the very same instance in
which lovers kiss, friends hug, and wallflowers stare awkwardly into a cup of liquor or juice. This
invisible line of course is the one that separates the New Years Resolutioners from the
Non-Resolutioners.

Despite generational parenting differences, children's voiced dreams are for the most part handled
with more care than adult's voice dreams simply because they cannot yet handle the full burden of
self-autonomy. While a parent may dread thinking about how they will handle future meals when a
child says they've made up their mind to be vegetarian, the actual thought of the child wanting not
to hurt animals is acknowledged and respected by adults. Of course being a child isn't easy either,
the [Season 16 9b episode of Arthur](https://arthur.fandom.com/wiki/Sue_Ellen_Vegges_Out) has
multiple attempts of children trying to sabotage others attempts to become vegetarian. These series
of underminings are sparked by Sue Ellen who befriends a pig on a farm and after announcing she
will become vegetarian invokes a series of events that unfolds into a public quarrel. Of course
being a children's show they learn from their mistakes, eventually reconcile and create Meatless
Mondays at school.

I am fairly sure the "real world" isn't as forgiving a place as an Arthur episode. Meatless Mondays
aren't so quickly organized and most kids wouldn't even bother to work towards organizing it to
begin with. These children grow up to become adults and these adults gain new dimensions of
sexuality, responsibility, existentiality, professionalism, etc that can modify and cover over the
pre-existing behaviour but in many ways they are simply new facets cleaved from the same diamond
formed at a young age.

It is interesting then to observe my surroundings for two weeks, devolve into these two populations
The same group of people which generally self considers itself as pluralistic, tolerant and
educated. Snide comments about new morning swimmers that don't know lane etiquette are mentioned in
change rooms, squash courts book up much quickly than usual and people tap their feet as they wait
for a squat rack or weight machine open up. What is the problem here? For once we see a society
where more people are trying to get exercise, taking risks to go places that may make them feel
uncomfortable and making an effort to wake up earlier. Like Boxing Day our hearts that were
supposed to be filled with kindred spirits find themselves filled with rage in traffic and
selfishness in stores. How quick we are to let "All Vengence be Forget" only to begin a new
vendetta the day after.

I provide no answers here, only encouragement that you the reader should try something new. Others
will say "Why this time of year? Why now? Why not before?" which I think is a little incredulous,
as the questioner ought to ask themselves "Why not now? Why does this part of the year preclude one
from trying new things?". I understand that the frustration one may feel can be misplaced and
directed towards the Weight Loss advertisements and dental ads for whiter teeth this time of year.
I understand that people feel that the majority of people who make a New Year's Resolution are
going to fail "according to statistics" although I would like to know where people found and vetted
these nice round survey statistic numbers. I understand people think most resolutions are created
out of vanity. What I do not understand is the hypocritical dichotomy of Christmas and Boxing Day,
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, and the sentiment showed all other months of the year compared
to right now.

Mario & The Magician
====================

I end this blog post on a transcript of the excellent commencement speech given by writer and
philosopher [David Foster Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace). For the
audiovisual inclined here is a [video of the
speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI&app=desktop). An interesting example of the
sentiment I hold comes around `13:55` when he discusses a negative and animus thought pattern that
is met by enthusiastic laughter and applause. He pulls back and waits for the excitement to die
down before stating that this is the very way to avoid thinking if one is to pride themselves in
studying the humanities. It is an uncanny mini case study that echos the thoughts of [Thomas
Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann)'s political work of [Mario and the
Magician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_and_the_Magician).

<p style="text-align:center">

</p>

A plot summary of Mario and the Magician is as follows

>The narrator describes a trip by his family to the fictional seaside town of Torre di Venere,
>Italy. It becomes unpleasant, partly because he finds the Italian people to be too nationalistic.
>The family attends a performance by a magician and hypnotist named Cipolla, who uses his mental
>powers in a "fascist" way to control his audience. Cipolla may well represent the mesmerizing
>power of authoritarian leaders in Europe at the time — he is autocratic, misuses power, and
>subjugates the masses in an attempt to counterbalance his inferiority complex by artificially
>boosting his self-confidence. Cipolla's assassination by Mario, a native of Torre di Venere, is
>not a tragedy but a liberation for the audience.

Unfortunately unlike the story, Wallace's taking of his own life 3 years after this speech is not a
liberation for the audience but rather echos his discussion of the "freedom" from the Wallace's
"terrible master" inside his head that so temptingly can _hypnotize_ our own thought. It is my
small hope that in the next two weeks a few people will trickle across this blog and be impacted by
it the way I was when I first read it. Now as society, we are graduating into a new decade and more
than ever could benefit from Wallace's words of wisdom.

This is Water by David Foster Wallace
=====================================

> Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon’s graduating class of 2005. There are these two
> young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods
> at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and
> then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”
>
> This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little
> parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty
> conventions of the genre, but if you’re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise,
> older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don’t be. I am not the wise old
> fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often
> the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this
> is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence,
> banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry
> and lovely morning.
>
> Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I’m supposed to talk about your
> liberal arts education’s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has
> actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let’s talk about the single most
> pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not
> so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about “teaching you how to think.” If you’re
> like me as a student, you’ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the
> claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got
> admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I’m
> going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because
> the really significant education in thinking that we’re supposed to get in a place like this
> isn’t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If
> your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time
> discussing, I’d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your
> scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.
>
> Here’s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the
> remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are
> arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth
> beer. And the atheist says: “Look, it’s not like I don’t have actual reasons for not believing in
> God. It’s not like I haven’t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last
> month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I
> couldn’t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and
> cried out ‘Oh, God, if there is a God, I’m lost in this blizzard, and I’m gonna die if you don’t
> help me.’” And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. “Well then
> you must believe now,” he says, “After all, here you are, alive.” The atheist just rolls his
> eyes. “No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the
> way back to camp.”
>
> It’s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same
> experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people’s
> two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience.
> Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we
> want to claim that one guy’s interpretation is true and the other guy’s is false or bad. Which is
> fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs
> come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person’s most basic
> orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired,
> like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we
> construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there’s the
> whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the
> possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are
> plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too.
> They’re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious
> dogmatists’ problem is exactly the same as the story’s unbeliever: blind certainty, a
> close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know
> he’s locked up.
>
> The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really
> supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness
> about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be
> automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the
> hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.
>
> Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of:
> everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre
> of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about
> this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it’s so socially repulsive. But it’s pretty
> much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth.
> Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of. The
> world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU,
> on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people’s thoughts and feelings have to be
> communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.
>
> Please don’t worry that I’m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness
> or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It’s a matter of my choosing to do
> the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is
> to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of
> self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being
> “well-adjusted”, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.
>
> Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of

> inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me,
> paying attention to what is going on inside me.
>
> As I’m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead

> now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal
> arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious

> you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to
> choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of
> choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about “the mind being an
> excellent servant but a terrible master.”
>
> This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and

> And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is
> supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable
> adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being

> abstract nonsense. Let’s get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet

>
> By way of example, let’s say it’s an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your

> good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you
> have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there’s no food at home.
> You haven’t had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you

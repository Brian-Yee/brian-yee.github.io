The Happy Hacking Keyboard
==========================

**Today I installed the finishing piece of on my Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB)!**

For the uninitiated there is a community of people who love the tactile sensation of typing, mainly
on mechanical keyboard that provide [haptic
feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology). Like the feeling of playing a real
piano vs a keyboard mechanical keyboard enthusiasts or "keebs" swear there is a difference to
mechanical keyboards and regular keyboards. The community broadly divides into two camps "Cherry
MX" or "Topre" each denoting a brand of mechanical keyboard with their own distinct feelings
regarding typing. As for the feeling -- I will admit that I enjoy my Topre keys more, however it is
the Unix friendly layout and aesthetic of the HHKB that I really do enjoy most.

In regards to this aesthetic of the HHKB I have made some sacrifices in feel for looks. Mainly
swapping out the legendary HHKB stock [PBT
plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybutylene_terephthalate) keycaps that feel divine for
[ABS plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene) to achieve a lovely
translucent purple. **If that wasn't sacrilegious enough** today I installed a keycap from a
different key-row profile onto a 3D printed Cherry-MX adaptor stem that uses some resin/plastic
that feels even wetter than ABS to make my little keyboard even more uniquely my own. The keycap
comes from the [Forbidden Realm Feburary 2018
Group-Buy](https://www.jellykey.com/artisan-keycaps/artifact-series-forbidden-realm-keycap/).
Unfortunately my camera phone can't quite catch the purple sparkle of the river in it but
regardless I still think it's beautiful. A little nature with me whenever I'm coding

This post is to discuss the process in case anybody else wants to mod their HHKB as well. To be
clear this is a _supplementary post_ to the excellent work done by
[rixtox](https://rix.li/topre-to-cherry-mx-adapter/) where he also does mods himself. However, this
post can provide a few things his cannot

1. Make you feel less guilty about how dirty your keyboard is -- rixtox's HHKB in the post is
   pristine it looks almost new! Mine has been well used and abused with my cat strutting her stuff
   over my keyboard whenever I'm trying to work
2. More data doesn't hurt when there's only one case study just trying to do a small part to move
   the needle from `n=1` to `n=2`
3. It can be hard to tell the scope of the work when a professional does it. I have no special
   parts. Everything is kinda improvised as handy to get to the end result. Hopefully, this gives
   others confidence to make a mod even if they feel they don't have all the tools.

Building the HHKB
=================

The Secret Sauce
----------------

The first step is to find a way to get [rixtox's 3D printer
models](https://github.com/rixtox/Topre-to-Cherry-MX-Adapter) into a 3D printer. This week my
friend told me he purchased a 3D printer in which I _immediately_ threw the file his way. If you do
not have a friend with a 3D printer you can go to your local library and many of them have
"makerspaces" where you can take courses to learn how to use their 3D printer.

Paperclip or Puller Get 'em Off
-------------------------------

This was the first time I used a keycap puller (that I got with my Ergodox EZ) and I gotta say it
was a much smoother experience then using bent paperclips. Still I would recommend against buying a
keycap puller when paperclips work just as well, albeit more slowly.

Clean Your Keyboard
-------------------

Nobody's perfect including me. While deconstructing your keyboard take this time to give it a much
needed cleaning. Now is the time [to go full Gattaca on
it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kTdh-u5tis). I cleaned my board multiple times throughout the
process but mostly at the end, counts is that it's clean before all caps go back on.

Pop the Lid
-----------

Your's will almost definitely look different as I previously modded my HHKB to use the [Hasu BT
Controller](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=71517.0) so that's why there's a battery kicking
around inside mine.

Switch the Screwdrivers
-----------------------

As can be seen in the picture above there are _many_ little screws that need to come out compared
to the three larger screws that hold the keyboard together. At this point I had to get creative and
switch screw drivers as my bicycle emergency multitool screwdriver was quite cumbersome. I found an
eyeglass repair kit around the house and grabbed the Philips screwdriver from it to use but the
screws are actually torqued in quite tightly. I ended up doing the first turn with the multitool
and then finish the rest off with the eyeglass repair kit Philips screwdriver. When reassembling I
did not try to achieve the same amount of torque and the electrocapicitive switches continued to
work just fine.

Separate the Rubbre Domehs
--------------------------

With all screws removed you can separate the rubbre domehs from the plunger board. **Be careful**.
I found that not all domes stayed stuck to the board and can fall off. Underneath is the spring
that pops the dome back up and this could easily fall/roll off your table. Obviously YMMV but
additional anticipation does not hurt here. **This will become a pain later so take care now**.

![Rubbre domehs](../images/hhkb/rubbre-domeh.jpg)

Mind the Hook
-------------

The least intuitive part is perhaps this step. Each Topre plunger has a little hook that prevents
the plunger from falling out when the plunger board is manipulated. It may seem scary but the way I
removed it is to bottom up the plunger and then use your narrow Philips (or corresponding flathead)
screwdriver to lever the _side with the hook_ against the channel to pop it out. I simply took lots
of caution and gradually used increasing force until this occurred.

![Rubbre domehs](../images/hhkb/hook.jpg)

Final Touches
-------------

Various 3D printers print in various qualities. I am by no means an expert with 3D printing but I
think it is safe to assume that [rixtox's 3D printer is very
nice](https://rix.li/topre-to-cherry-mx-adapter/) as the adaptor I had printed was notably rougher
then the smooth pictures I had seen before. **As can be seen Rixtox's keycaps do not have hooks**.
Theoretically, if you flip the adapted board upside down all plungers will fall out. This makes
reassembling the board a bit trickier but you can still rotate the plunger board to a little over
90 degrees before the custom plungers slide out. The corresponded rubbre domeh board can prevent
domes from falling by rotating to a little less than 90 degrees and each can be sandwiched to
reassemble but were getting ahead of ourselves here.

![Comparison of custom rixtox adaptors to stock](../images/hhkb/comparison.png)

The dimensions of the custom adaptor are still close enough that it could be slotted in **with some
resistance** during the plunging process. To reduce this I took some random file I found in my
house and smoothed out the contact points

![Sanding down a custom rixtox adaptor](../images/hhkb/sanding.gif)

After sanding the rixtox plunger slides much more smoothly into the plunger board.

Reassemble
----------

Then you just literally do everything in reverse and enjoy your new keyboard. Sorry no pictures for
this step. Just some steady hands, patience and a little nervousness that you didn't screw anything
up.

Pics or It Didn't Happen
========================

Here's a close up of the keycap

I think the lighting of my HHKB in this picture of it on top of a mountain with a curious chipmunk
more accurately displays what it looks like IRL.

Summary
=======

Today I modded my HHKB to add a keycap to it that I bought nearly two years ago. The delayed
installation of the key was finally performed with the help of a friend who purchased a 3D printer
this week. Some of the defects from his printer were sanded off to ensure a smooth tactile feel and
the adaptor was installed. Additionally my keyboard got a much needed cleaning.

The goal of this post was to satisfy some of the curiosity of HHKB owners in the difficulty in
doing a more complex modification (then say the Hasu BT Controller mod) to their HHKB. Provided you
have a local public library with access to a 3D printer and the desire for artisan keycaps exists
in your heart: this post should have encouraged you to go out and quell it. I'm a little torn on
how high the keycap comes up off my keyboard given at the time of the purchase I did not have the
foresight or perhaps knowledge to understand the full process. However, much as our flaws make us
unique and within that individualism there is room for serendipitous insights the keycap coming up
so high allows others to more easily appreciate the full craftsmanship of the keycap. Not sure if I
would ever really aim for that but as the HHKB FN key I don't hit it enough to have it disrupt my
workflow and make an interesting conversation starter. Nonetheless, the exercise of modding and
creating is quite nice and I will think fondly of this step in the journey of me and my HHKB.

title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm Brian. This is my site, this is my About Me page that is an attempt to convey myself in a
timely bite-sized chunk of text. To save your time I will enumerate all the factual observations
you would make of me over time:

- I am a consultant specializing in Machine Learning with 3 years experience.
- I have an MSc in theoretical physics and another in comp-sci
- I read fairly ferociously you can usually find some denser philosophical book paired with a
  slimmer [Penguin's Great Idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Great_Ideas) book in my
  backpack at all times
- I am a triathlete that focuses on long-distance racing (Ironman 70.3, Ironman)
- I adhere to a vegan diet + eggs (gotta get that B12 and complete amino acid profile!)
- I spend around 20 minutes a day playing with my cat.

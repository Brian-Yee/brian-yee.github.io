# Welcome

Hi there, thanks for visiting my corner of the web.

# What's With the Weird Header and Footers?

They're nods to one of my favourite essayists: George Orwell. The header is the title of this
website and a play on words combining his essay [Thoughts on the Common
Toad](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/some-thoughts-on-the-common-toad/)
with the philosophical concept of the modes of Dasein's existence. Bascially, essays from the
existance of my everyday life. The bottom is from his essay [A Good Word for the Vicor of
Bray](http://george-orwell.org/A_Good_Word_For_The_Vicar_of_Bray/0.html).

# What Can I Get Out of This Site?

That's such a highly personal question it's hard to say. However, if your interested in any coding,
philosophy (applied), triathlon or cooking those are the things I am interested in and will be
writing about.

# What Should I Read First?

I've compiled a [list of curated links](curated-links.md) that is always accessible at the top. It is composed of
articles across the web that I have really enjoyed reading (or writing) and think you might enjoy
as well.

# Who are You? What do You Do?

I'm Brian. To save your time I will enumerate over the factual observations you would make of me in
real life (although obviously everyone is more than they just simply appear factually):

- I am Senior Developer at the Canadian Broadcasting Company and a Machine Learning consultant with
  3 years experience building and deploying models that work.
- Before entering industry I aquired an MSc in theoretical physics (University of Waterloo) and
  another in comp-sci (Simon Fraser University).
- I read somewhat ferociously. You can usually find a denser philosophy book paired with a slim
  copy of a [Penguin's Great Idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Great_Ideas) series book
  in my backpack at all times.
- I am a triathlete that focuses on long-distance racing (Ironman 70.3, Ironman), my fiance and I
  take the sport quite seriously, although she is disproportionatly faster than me.
- I adhere to a vegan diet + eggs (gotta get that B12 and complete amino acid profile).
- I spend around 20 minutes a day playing with my cat.
